        "text": "Before we jump into the guide and tips on defeating enemies, let this corner give you a brief background about this simulator. Initially, the game started in Sakura Town in Japan. There are five characters to choose from: Rina Tamaki, Taiga Yuki, Yuta Aida, Mio Aida, and a robot named Cat Butler.

As you’re set in the game, you will witness the real everyday life of a high school student in Japan. In this game, you can change and control the four players in the same position. Take note that every action you do with the NPC will significantly affect your gameplay, leading you into various situations.
One thing you can do to defeat your enemies in the future is to customize your characters. You can even wear clothes with extraordinary powers. For example, the Alice in Wonderland dress can give your character the ability to grow and shrink. These costumes can escalate your damage.",
